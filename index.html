<p>Curriculum-based course timetabling solver; uses Tabu Search or Simulated Annealing</p>

<p>The validator was compiled using Visual Studio 2012; it might not work on all configurations of Windows.
In case the validator does not work, it needs to be recompiled using the included validator.cc source code file.</p>

<p>The solver was implemented in and requires an installation of Python 3.</p>

<p>The solver is started by executing the Main.py script found in the solver folder.
The user is then asked to choose a dataset (0 for the test dataset and 1 for the comp dataset),
to choose a test instance (a number between 1-4 when the test dataset was chosen, 1-21 when the comp
dataset was chosen or 0 to select the toy instance) and to input the maximum runtime of the solver in seconds.</p>

<p>Example:
"Select a dataset"&gt;&gt;&gt;1</p>

<p>"Select an instance from the dataset"&gt;&gt;&gt;5</p>

<p>"For how many seconds should the solver be allowed to run?"&gt;&gt;&gt;200</p>

<p>This input selects the comp dataset, instance 5 from the comp dataset and lets the solver run for 200 seconds.</p>

<p>Further settings can be made by overwriting the default values in the initialisation.py script.</p>

<p>The solution timetables produced by the solver are saved to the folder "Solutions" in the solver folder.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the program as well as a theoretical background to the university course timetabling problem is given in the thesis paper: <a href="https://github.com/stBecker/CB-CTT_Solver/blob/master/Metaheuristic%20algorithms%20for%20the%20automated%20timetabling%20of%20university%20courses.pdf">"Metaheuristic algorithms for the automated timetabling of university courses.pdf"</a></p>
